In your case it means that one of your visitors entered a wrong URL in the address bar, or that you or another website has a dead link. When possible, the referrer is shown so you can find the page\/site which contains the dead link. If not, it generally means that it is a direct access, so someone may have bookmarked a link which doesn&#39;t exist anymore.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>How to catch these errors?<\/strong><br \/>\r\nIf your webhost supports .htaccess files, you can create one in the root directory of PrestaShop and insert the following line inside: &quot;ErrorDocument 404 \/404.php&quot;.<br \/>\r\nA user requesting a page which doesn&#39;t exist will be redirected to the following page: \/404.php.
